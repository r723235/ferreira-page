As you may or may not know, adopting requires a bit of paperwork, legal stuff, and logistical things, so it's a tad expensive. We understand it and don't feel negatively towards it, because we know the intense process is to make sure every child is placed with a safe family.

Our agency has provided an estimated "at-a-glance" fees breakdown:

- Agency Fees
- Third Party Fees
- Travel Expenses
- Other miscellaneous items

Thankfully, each of these don't have to be paid up front and are staggered throughout the process.

[That said, we would be honored if you would consider partnering with us to help pay for some of these heavy costs as we move forward.](http://cash.app/$rafaelferreira)
